**[Soundian](https://www.soundian.com/)** is an instant messaging app which lets users mix customized sounds and share them with friends. Soundian aims to make communication faster and more personal at the same time.

While working at Telekom Innovation Lab's Creation Centre, I developed the user flow and interface of Soundian's new feature - a voice recorder. This involved designing for the experience of 1. Selecting a sound from the Sound packs; 2. Recording your own sound emoticon; and then 3. Sharing these sounds across platforms or within Soundian.
