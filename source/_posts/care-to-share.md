In India, 50,000 women die during childbirth every year. As the second most populous country in the world, India’s healthcare system is overstretched and underfunded. In there circumstances, Care2Share attempts to put women at the heart of the solution to improving Quality of Care. Care2Share is a service that facilitates a feedback cycle that promotes positive changes in maternal healthcare in India.

Over the 1 year long project, I played contributed in the capacity of design research, concept development, UX and visual design.
