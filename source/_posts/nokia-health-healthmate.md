In 2017, Nokia Health acquired [Withings](https://www.withings.com/fi/en/store?gclid=CjwKCAjwtO7qBRBQEiwAl5WC27MZ7qJt8TCCiqUX-OjK3qLZokRXGbK1cFmMVfE4W_Abd0zMiqsuQRoCZnAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), a digital health company. I joined the Design team at Nokia as a UX Consultant to research potential synergies between existing technologies at Nokia and the Withings ecosystem.

I specifically researched how a medical technology created at Nokia can be transformed into a viable business, product and service. I used co-creation techniques methods with the engineering, medical, and design teams at Nokia to identify concrete market opportunities.

I mapped different scenarios where this medical device can work with the [Healthmate App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/withings-health-mate/id542701020) to translate health data into actionable information for different types of user groups. Additionally, I created a set of guidelines for Future of Healthcare Design for the new Nokia Health team.

During this project, I learnt a lot about the future of healthcare, predictive diagnosis and digital therapeutics. By working in a global organisation with remote teams, I got the experience of co-creating with different divisions, product owners, engineers, doctors and other internal stakeholders. I also learnt a lot from working with a team of design specialists who support both software and hardware development for other future facing Nokia services.
